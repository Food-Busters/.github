> We aim at reducing pollution from food waste and develop healthy diet.

**Food Busters** is an idea from high school students to submit at AIS Jump Thailand Hackathon 2021,
after the hackathon we also submit this idea to Diamond Challenge 2022 and this spring, we entered AIS Jump Bootcamp 2022
to learn about business, marketing to further improve our idea.

This GitHub Organization's Repositories contain source codes for our prototypes.
